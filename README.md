# MORSELANG - The Morse Code Programming Language

**MORSELANG** is a playful esoteric programming language just weird enough to be delightful. It’s a language where your keywords go `beep-boop`, your code looks like an encrypted transmission, and your compiler tries its absolute best to pretend this is normal.

perfect for tinkering, experimenting, and showing off the fact that you created a language where typing `---` might actually do something important and nobody can stop you.

## Why?

Because my anime is on a cliffhanger and productivity had to go somewhere.
